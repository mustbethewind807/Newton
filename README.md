# Newton

A very bad physics library that i am working on.

Renders using the p5.js library (currently, for debugging purposes)  
Mostly likely will still use p5 for rendering as I suck at WebGL  
I might use WebGL, but that will be in the far future

Currently has:

* An engine that runs (away from you)
* Entities (only rectangles)
* Vector library
* Collision detection
* A (somewhat) proper renderer

Currently does not have:

* Collision resolving
* Other primitive shapes
* Rotations
* Complex bodies
* Spring physics
* Soft body physics
* Practical use
* Job applications
* Anything you can think of

It's just a goofy library I'm making for fun.

Newton will most likely become a game engine, because I have no use for a physics engine.
