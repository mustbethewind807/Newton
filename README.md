# Newton

A very bad physics library that i am working on.

Renders using the p5.js library (currently, for debugging purposes)

Currently has:

* An engine that runs (away from you)
* Entities (only rectangles)
* Vector library

Currently does not have:

* Collision detection
* Collision resolving
* A proper renderer
* Other primitive shapes
* Rotations
* Complex bodies
* Spring physics
* Soft body physics
* Practical use
* Job applications
* Anything you can think of

It's just a goofy library I'm making for fun.
